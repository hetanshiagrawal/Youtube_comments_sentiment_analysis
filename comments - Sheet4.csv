In IsIdentical part at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DzowlcaUmE&amp;t=1h17m51s"">1:17:51</a>, if subRoot is on leaf but root is not on leaf then also it should be a part of the tree right. <br><br>Say rootNodes array in preorder sequence is { 1, 2, 4, 6, -1, -1, 7, -1, -1, 5, -1, -1 3, -1, -1} and subNodes array is {2, 4, -1, -1, 5, -1, -1}.

Raushan Paswan,"Dear Shraddha Didi, you&#39;re doing a mistake in finding the height of the tree. Because in a tree, the height of any node is the number of edges from the leaf node to that node in the longest path. And the height of the root node is known as the height of the tree. If we have no node then the height of the tree is -1 and If we have a single node then the height is 0.<br>Code:<br> public static int height(Node root){<br>            if(root==null){<br>                return -1;<br>            }<br>            <br>            int leftnode=height(root.left);<br>            int rightnode=height(root.right);<br>            <br>            return Math.max(leftnode,rightnode)+1;<br>        }",2022-09-03T11:49:50Z,0,0
