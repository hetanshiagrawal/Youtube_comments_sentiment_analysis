ak,"I came here after watching Code with Harry&#39;s 100 Days of Code tutorial. I think that is easier than this and also a lot of things are explained in that course. In this course only basic things have been explained. Many concepts like exception handling, virtual environment, object oriented programming(oops)and a lot more are skipped in this video. Also that course is more organized than this one as that course increases the difficulty level slowly and it has some more practical and difficult problems than this one..<br>So I would suggest you to watch that tutorial to learn Python completely. You will surely understand it even if you are a beginner like me.",2023-06-25T10:53:53Z,1,0

You have put all the basics very level for someone who wants to start with python as their first programming language. Now, the next logical step would be to teach advanced level concepts so that the course really makes sense for all. You kept is very simple and that made all of us believe that python is a right programming language to start with.
